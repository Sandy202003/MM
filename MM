<h1> Influencers in the wild</h1>
<p> Most influncers like to think that their ass is the most important and valuable asset.</p>

<p> Wherever the place their gonna pull it out anyway.</p>
<h4><mark> example </mark></h4>
<p> A lady went on a ski trip and the only thing that was on her mind was not to ski. Instead she whip her booty out.<br> The mountain ranger had to go over and ask her to stop because there were kids around because its a <b> PUBLIC MOUNTAIN. </b> </p>
<img src="image/influencer.jpg" alt="influencer">
<p> My only question is why would a person go to an environment that is historically family friendly and do that.</p>
<p> We should tell these influencers that everything you do is not supposed to be sexual and showing off the female body</p>
